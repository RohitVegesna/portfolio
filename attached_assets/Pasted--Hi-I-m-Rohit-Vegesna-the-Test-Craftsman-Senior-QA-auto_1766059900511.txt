Hi, I'm Rohit Vegesna
the Test Craftsman! 
Senior QA automation developer | .NET Specialist 
Crafting scalable test automation frameworks for web, API, and cloud-based applications 


11+ Years Exp.

Across global enterprises, consulting environments, and product-based companies. 

1500+ Test Cases

Robust coverage across UI, API, and integration layers. 

CI/CD expert 

Built scalable pipelines and custom test frameworks from the ground up. 

Quality mindset

Delivering clean releases through strategy, scripting, and data-driven testing.


Test automation isn't just code — it's trust, speed, and peace of mind, wrapped in logic. 
🏆 Quality-Driven Philosophy 

I believe in embedding quality at every stage of the software lifecycle — not just as a final check, but as a guiding principle. My goal is to ensure robust, scalable, and maintainable solutions that make quality measurable, consistent, and deeply integrated into delivery pipelines. 

🤖 Automation as a Functional Force 

With a strong foundation in CI/CD, custom test frameworks, and end-to-end automation, I focus on driving speed, reliability, and test coverage. From UI and API layers to backend systems, I build automation that enables teams to deliver with confidence — and scale with ease. 

🧠 Analytical Impact & Business Alignment 

Beyond testing, I use data and domain knowledge to guide decision-making. Whether it's analyzing test data for dashboards, identifying bottlenecks, or aligning test strategy with business goals, I strive to make QA a strategic contributor to product and customer success
